E-tiffin is an online food marketplace where anyone can sell and buy food. here i used MEAN stack to implement the whole project as best to my abilities.
the welcome page and styling in the project is very minimal as i didnt get enough time to do the designing.
there are 2 users admin and user:
1. user can add and read from the mongo db.
2. admin can update and remove data.

once logged in the user can press the menu button to see and order the item. pressing the add button the same user can add new items to menu
the menu is catagorised into 3 breakfast, lunch, dinner.all of them are saved in the same collection.
